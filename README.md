# Government Data Requests Visualization
This is a visualization of how many data requests have been made by various governments to three tech giants Facebook, Google and Microsoft by various governments from 2012 to 2017. It was created during the Data Visualization course at UCSC in 2018 by me, Sean Gaudefroy and Mike Pluguez.
